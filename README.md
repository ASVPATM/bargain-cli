  **ONLY LOCAL OPTION/CRAIGSLIST IS WORKING AT THIS TIME**

Designed to have a simple interface and make it easy to search for bargains either near you, or available for shipping.

**Main Idea For The Project**
- Asking User
  - If they would like to make a query through all the sites, or just one
  - If they want to look at only local options, shipping options, or both
    - If its Local, I ask for their general location (their city) 
  - If they want to set a max/min price
  - Then Ask for Query

- Then Request from Each Website their query
- Parse the HTML to collect the main information needed
- Things like
  - Title
  - Price
  - Location (IF City given)
 
- No pictures but gives the user the option to open listing in browser (not implemented)
- Choice to see one-three listings a page (not implementd)

**install requirements with pip**

**Run User_Interact Py file First**

Slowly working on this because im trying to find the time but I've made most of the groundwork for it
